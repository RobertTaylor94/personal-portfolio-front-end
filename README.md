# personal-portfolio-front-end

## Description
For our second weeks challenge we were tasked with creating a portfolio website using responsive web design and CSS features such as flfexbox and grid. I have built the site using repsonsive elements to look good on both widescreen and mobile devices and have allowed for the addition of new projects to my 'Work' section as a complete more projects.

## Features
Through the use of tools learnt in class and independent research I have enable several features. The navigation bar along the top of the site links to each section and will take a user there. 

CSS grid has allowed me to create a responsive grid that I can add more projects too in the future.

Hover effects such as the change in opacity when hovering over a project in widescreen browsers has been enabled using CSS.
